## Instructions
### Prepare the Data

- Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

    - The first five rows of the scaled DataFrame should appear as follows:

### Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
- Use the elbow method to find the best value for `k`
- Plot a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of `k` to visually identify the optimal value for `k`.
- Answer the following question in your notebook: What is the best value for `k`?
### Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data

- Cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for `k` on the original scaled data
- Predict the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies using the original scaled DataFrame.
- Create a copy of the original data and add a new column with the predicted clusters.
- Create a scatter plot using hvPlot
### Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
- Using the original scaled DataFrame, perform a PCA and reduce the features to three principal components.

- Retrieve the explained variance to determine how much information can be attributed to each principal component and then answer the following question in your notebook:

    - What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?
- Create a new DataFrame with the PCA data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

    - The first five rows of the PCA DataFrame should appear as follows:

### Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
Use the elbow method on the PCA data to find the best value for `k` using the following steps:

- Create a list with the number of k-values from 1 to 11.
- Create an empty list to store the inertia values.
- Create a `for` loop to compute the inertia with each possible value of `k`.
- Create a dictionary with the data to plot the Elbow curve.
- Plot a line chart with all the inertia values computed with the different values of `k` to visually identify the optimal value for `k`.
- Answer the following question in your notebook:
    - What is the best value for `k` when using the PCA data?
    - Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?
### Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
Use the following steps to cluster the cryptocurrencies for the best value for `k` on the PCA data:

- Initialize the K-means model with the best value for `k`.
- Fit the K-means model using the PCA data.
- Predict the clusters to group the cryptocurrencies using the PCA data.
- Create a copy of the DataFrame with the PCA data and add a new column to store the predicted clusters.
- Create a scatter plot using hvPlot as follows:
    - Set the x-axis as "price_change_percentage_24h" and the y-axis as "price_change_percentage_7d".
    - Color the graph points with the labels found using K-means.
    - Add the "coin_id" column in the `hover_cols` parameter to identify the cryptocurrency represented by each data point.
- Answer the following question:
    - What is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?
